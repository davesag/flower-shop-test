# flower-bundler â€” Cogent Developer Test

This is [Dave Sag](http://cv.davesag.com)'s implementation of [Cogent](http://www.cogent.co)'s developer test.

*If you have been asked to do this test I urge you to not to copy my, or anyone else's, work.*

## Declaration

I solemnly declare that I did not copy this code from anyone else, and that it's all my own original  work.

## Approach

I selected `Ruby version 2.2.2` as the language to write this in, which is fair given I am pitching for a `Ruby` focused job.

I started by converting the requirements into a simple suite of `rspec` tests set to `skip` just to get down everything I figured I'd need.

_fill this in later_

## Design

_fill this in later_

## Setup

There are a few dependencies so first run

```sh
bundle
```

## To run

The test is already in the form of a suite of `rspec` tests so simply run

```sh
rspec
```

There are _x_ tests giving a _x_% code coverage of the project.

## License

Even though you are not meant to copy this if doing a test; I'm not at all precious about it, and hey, it's not my test, just my stab at it.
